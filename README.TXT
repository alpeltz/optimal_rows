This program is to find the optimal 3 lines of a bingo card.
Please run it by including a file in the same directory as 
optimal_rows.py named "matrix.txt" that includes
a 5 x 5 matrix of numbers, formated like the sample matrix.txt file included in the repo.
Do not add any whitespace after the last number in any row. Separate all numbers by
a space. 

It will return the top 5 routes based off of point sums alone.

Run program by running "python optimal_rows.py"
